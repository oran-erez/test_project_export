#  Create a Fabric Project

Now that you are familiar with Fabric’s use cases and benefits and know how to analyze an implementation’s business requirements, let’s look at your first business scenario and follow its steps: ![](/academy/Training_Level_1/03_fabric_basic_LU/images/fabric_main_flow_02.png)                                               

### Create a New Fabric Project

Similar to other implementations, you will need to setup the project, which means using the Fabric Studio to structure and save the relevant information.

To do so, follow these steps:

- [Create a new Project](/articles/04_fabric_studio/05_creating_a_new_project.md)

- [Fabric Project Structure](/articles/04_fabric_studio/08_fabric_project_tree.md)

- [Add the Fabric Project to Version Control](/articles/04_fabric_studio/06_adding_fabric_projects_to_version_control.md)  

  

![](/academy/Training_Level_1/03_fabric_basic_LU/images/information.png) To learn more about our best practices for working with version control, refer to [Best Practices for Working with GIT and SVN](/articles/04_fabric_studio/07_best_practices_for_working_with_GIT_and_SVN.md).



Now that you have created a new project, let’s define basic configurations using the Fabric Studio so that you can understand its components:

- [User Preferences](/articles/04_fabric_studio/04_user_preferences.md)
- [UI Components and Menus](/articles/04_fabric_studio/01_UI_components_and_menus.md)
- [Window Tabs Context Menus](/articles/04_fabric_studio/02_window_tab_context_menu.md)
- [Diagram and Toolbars](/articles/04_fabric_studio/03_diagram_and_toolbars.md)

 

You have now set the basic configurations needed to start your first Fabric project implementation.
