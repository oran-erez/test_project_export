# Fabric Use Cases



Now that you understand what Fabric is and what you will gain from its usage once you harness its technology, we would like to share with you what our customers have achieved after streamlining Fabric into their complex business flows.



**Use Case 1 - Merger of Wireless Companies** 

After a multi-billion North American wireless company acquired two of its competitors, they needed to combine their acquired systems with their own. By leveraging K2View Fabric and its patented use of micro-databases, the company was able to deliver full Customer 360 access and control including:

\- Integrated data across three separate companies in only three weeks

\- A customer data hub supporting 15 million customers across 1,000 locations

\- Saving multi-millions of USD n infrastructure and manpower. 

*It took just three weeks to implement the K2View Fabric solution, which gave the wireless company a single source of data and allowed it to meet the governmentâ€™s requirements and deadline for the merger.* 

*Customer-facing applications were integrated directly into K2View Fabric, reducing the data latency from minutes to milliseconds. The implementation and its deployment had zero impact on legacy systems operations, and the company reports 100 percent availability of customer data since deployment.*

 

 

**Use Case 2 - 360 Network Monitoring**

A global internet services provider needed to improve their customer experience and support by anticipating failure of their equipment across multiple countries. The company's monitoring systems already automatically received tickets generated from alerts raised by the equipment installed at customer premises. Alerts could be triggered by outage, performance issues or data usage. 

Implementing K2View Fabric enabled the company to integrate their customer data with their equipment network's topology records into one platform. By doing so, they created a 360 view of their network for millions of customers, sending thousands of concurrent alarms - 100 thousand per day - across the entire park. This resulted in:

\- Real-time aggregation of alarms.

\- Identifying issues before they are noticed by a customer, whereby significantly reducing calls to Support.  

\- Ensuring real-time correlation between network events, impacted customers and spatial occurrences to enable proactive communication and swift resolution of issues.

\- Efficiently forwarding customer calls to the matching handling team, message, or field operatives.

\- Significantly cutting AHT by ensuring consolidated customer360.

\- Proactive discovery and identification of new types of outages.
