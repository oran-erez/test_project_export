# Invoking a Web Service

Now that you have created and deployed you first Web Service into Fabric,  you can see the data by invoking it from the Fabric Studio or by using any API client. Since Fabric's Web Services comply with REST API  guidelines, they are fully integrated with the latest Open API platform - **Swagger**.

### Invoking and Testing Web Services

Let's learn how to invoke and test a Web Service from the Fabric Studio using [Swagger](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/09_swagger.md):

To ensure that the data being exposed by the Web Service is secured, authenticated and executed, click [Fabric Credentials Commands](/articles/17_fabric_credentials/02_fabric_credentials_commands.md) and then set the Web Service credentials.	



### ![](/academy/Training_Level_1/03_fabric_basic_LU/images/example.png)Example - Invoking a Web Service

1. Right click the **Web Service**, select **Invoke Web Service** and then the **preferred environment** which can be either the Fabric server name or Local Fabric (debug).
  
  
   Swagger is prompted and the invoked Web Service is expanded. Note that since the defined **Verb** for the Web Service included all GET, POST, PUT and DELETE options, they are all available. The GET (default) option is expanded.
3. Click **Try it out**, set the **i_id** to **82** and execute. 
  
    What is the response? Failed to authorize. 

    Why? The Web Service is requiring a token for authentication. 
  
4. For the request to succeed, create the permissions and a token:
   ```
    create user 'test_user'; 
    create role 'admin'; 
    grant ALL_WS on * to 'admin'; 
    assign role 'admin' to user 'test_user';`
    create token test; 
    assign role 'admin' to token test; 
   ```

5. Go back and try to execute the Web Service again. Click the **Lock**, set a valid **Token** and **close**.
7. Set the **i_id** to **82** and execute. 
  
   What is the Customer's first name? Anthony

Using the training materials and examples covered so far:

Create a new version for **wsGetCustomer** to enhance the current functionality:

- [ ]  Return the Customer's details including their contracts and associated subscribers. 

- [ ] The returned reponse should be based on SUBSCRIBER.VIP_STATUS. 

- [ ] Only the Customer's full name should appear as part of the response. 

- [ ] Make sure the WS path is the same for both Web Services.

  

1. `Question: What is the SSN of Customer 1?`

2. `Question: How many subscribers has Customer 1 with VIP_STATUS "Platinum"?`

3. `Question: What is the CONTRACT_DESCRIPTION of the Subscriber with VIP_STATUS "Silver" ?`

4. `Question: Which version of your Web Service will be executed if the version is not set?`

```java
wsGetCustomer2 ; path :test/getCustomerDetails 

String sql = "select cust.FIRST_NAME||' '||cust.LAST_NAME CUSTOMER_NAME, cont.CONTRACT_ID,cont.CONTRACT_DESCRIPTION," +
        "sub.SUBSCRIBER_ID,sub.MSISDN,sub.IMSI,sub.SIM,sub.SUBSCRIBER_TYPE,sub.VIP_STATUS " +
		"from CUSTOMER cust, CONTRACT cont, SUBSCRIBER sub where cont.CONTRACT_ID=sub.SUBSCRIBER_ID and sub.VIP_STATUS=?";

Db.Rows rows = ludb("CustomerLU", i_id).fetch(sql, i_vipStatus);

return rows;
```
