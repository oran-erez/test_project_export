# Sync of a Logical Unit Instance - Overview

The Sync mechanism synchronizes data between data sources and the Fabric database. During a sync, extraction and transformation processes are executed on an [LU Instance (LUI)](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md#lui) whereby data is retrieved from the source systems and then loaded into the Fabric database. 
 
**A sync on an LUI can be initiated in two modes**:
* Proactive sync , synchronizing LUI proactively by interacting with a CDC tool that feeds Fabric with data changes from source systems. This solution is based on an initial load process that sets a baseline for the data in Fabric before the feeds are received from the CDC tool. 

  A Proactive approach is required in huge systems that have millions of database changes per second with many CSRs simultaneously querying Fabric and requesting fresh data. The CSR must receive a quick response and cannot wait for the data to be refreshed online from source systems. Synchronizing database changes proactively into Fabric ensures a much faster response time to CSR requests for data. 
* Lazy (on-demand) sync, synchronizing an LUI on demand. For example, a data sync is initiated for Customer 123 when a CSR in a Call Center triggers a Fabric WS call requesting fresh data for Customer 123. Fabric only updates data in Customer 123 upon request when the data is needed by the user. A Lazy sync is initiated based on a predefined [sync method](/articles/14_sync_LU_instance/04_sync_methods.md) on the LU and the [sync mode](/articles/14_sync_LU_instance/02_sync_modes.md).

  A sync on an LUI (like Customer) executes extraction and transformation logic on the [LU tables](/articles/06_LU_tables/01_LU_tables_overview.md) and then populates them in the LUI. Both LU [population objects](/articles/07_table_population/01_table_population_overview.md) and enrichment functions are executed in a Sync process.
