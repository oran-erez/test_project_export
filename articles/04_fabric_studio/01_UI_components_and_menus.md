### What Is the Fabric Studio User Interface?
Fabric Studio is a designer tool that manages the construction of [Digital Entities](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md#digital-entity). As an integrated tool, Fabric allows you to implement mapping rules into a project and to deploy your implementation to the Fabric Server.

Built over a Windows-based platform, Fabric Studio offers a user friendly look-and-feel development environment known as the Implementation Layer. Each project is initiated and maintained through this platform and working space.\

As an integrated tool, Fabric Studio allows you to:
* Design [Digital Entities](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md#digital-entity) and their associated [Logical Units (LUs)](/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md).
* Use robust ETL options to define the mapping logic on each LU table using various transformation objects like [Functions](/articles/07_table_population/08_project_functions.md), [Globals](/articles/08_globals/01_globals_overview.md) or [Translations](/articles/09_translations/01_translations_overview_and_use_cases.md).
* Deploy a [Fabric project](/articles/04_fabric_studio/05_creating_a_new_project.md) or selected components of a project to the Fabric runtime environment. 
* [Debug and view](/articles/13_LUDB_viewer_and_studio_debug_capabilities/01_data_viewer.md) mapped data, data flow and data exposure. 

Fabric Studio also enables you to integrate your projects into Source Version Control systems based on Git or the Apache Sub-version (SVN) Standard.

### How Can I Use the Fabric Studio Start Page?

![image](/articles/04_fabric_studio/images/04_01_01_start_a_page.png)

The Start Page has links to different K2View Fabric projects, including: 
* Start a new project, with or without configuration control. 
* Open an existing project.
* Checkout a project from the configuration control.
* Quick links to recently opened projects. 
* Help and User Guide. 

[Click for more information about Creating a New Project.](/articles/04_fabric_studio/05_creating_a_new_project.md)

Click the K2View icon on the top left corner of the Studio to restore, move, size, minimize, maximize or close the Fabric Studio.

[Click for more information about the Query Builder.](/articles/11_query_builder/01_query_builder_overview.md#query-builder-overview)

### What Are the File Tab Options?
The File tab has the following options:
* New Project. 
* Open Project. 
* Checkout Project (from SVN or Git repository). 
* Close Project. 
* Recent Projects.

### New Item Tab Options
Click **New Item** to open a **New Item** under a selected **LU** or Shared **Objects**:
* Select a **LU** from the current **Logical Unit** dropdown list to create the new item under the selected **LU**. For example, a new [Function](/articles/07_table_population/09_creating_an_LUDB_function.md), [LU Table,](/articles/06_LU_tables/01_LU_tables_overview.md) [Interface](/articles/05_DB_interfaces/01_interfaces_overview.md) or [Global](/articles/08_globals/01_globals_overview.md).
* To create a new item under [Shared Objects](/articles/04_fabric_studio/12_shared_objects.md), the current Logical Unit dropdown list should be blank.

Note that this area allows you to open a new item only for LU or Shared Objects. 

### What Are the Main Elements of the Project Tree? 
The Project Tree displays the components of the current project as a hierarchy of entities. The main elements of the hierarchy include:
* Project, the top-level of the hierarchy. Each project has the following branches (sub-objects): 
  * [Shared Objects](/articles/04_fabric_studio/12_shared_objects.md) used by all Logical Units and project references and may include a sub-hierarchy, as follows:
    * Globals. 
    * Environments. 
    * Database types. 
    * Interfaces. 
    * Functions. 
    * Java, Java files and resource files. 
    * Translations. 
* References, reference information that may be used throughout the instance. 
* Web Services, a collection of all functions that are defined as Web Services for this project.
* [Logical Units](/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md), a collection of all Logical Units defined in the project.

**Note:** All operations performed in the Project Treeâ€™s options are accessible from the context menus of the different components in the Project Tree. For example, creating a new function is accessed from the context menu when you right click the Functions object in the Project Tree.
