# Shared Objects

Shared Objects can be used in all components of a Fabric project. For example, [Logical Units](/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md), References, Web Services or processes. 

### Which Objects Can be Shared in a Fabric Project?

The following components can be shared in a Fabric project:
* Environments, where you can define the number of environments according to your needs and also switch between environments in the same Fabric project.
* Database Types, where you can define a new database type that has a JDBC driver that is not part of the Product package. In addition, you can also edit product-supported database types which are used when defining interfaces.
* [Interfaces](/articles/05_DB_interfaces/01_interfaces_overview.md), a list of source connection details defined for the project.  
* [Java files](/articles/04_fabric_studio/09_logic_files_and_categories.md) and resource files:
  * SharedLogic.java, (default) containing all shared [Functions](/articles/07_table_population/06_table_population_transformation_rules.md#functions) from all categories, except for Product functions.
  * SharedLogic.java, per category, containing all shared [Functions](/articles/07_table_population/06_table_population_transformation_rules.md#functions) for a defined physical category. Each SharedLogic.java file is positioned under the relevant Category folder.
  * SharedGlobals.java, containing all shared [Globals](/articles/08_globals/01_globals_overview.md) in a set of global parameters. 
Note that if a Global that is defined in both a Shared Object and a specific Logical Unit, the Global defined in the specific Logical Unit is used. Other Logical Units use the definitions in the Shared Object.
  * Resources, various files that can be saved both as part of a project and also in version control.
  * [Translations](/articles/09_translations/01_translations_overview_and_use_cases.md), sets of translations which can be used for the transformation of data. A Translation defined at a Shared Objects level may be used in any LU included in the project. 

**Notes** 
* If a function or a translation is defined both under Shared Objects and under a Logical Unit with the same name and parameters, the [Logical Unit](/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md) function code has priority.
* Since Shared Objects **are not** self-deployed, changes to an item under a Shared Object used by several components require redeployment to become available.
