# Legacy Annotation

The Full Alignment with RESTful Web Services functionality was introduced in Fabric 5.5.  When updating projects to enable backwards compatibility while preserving the existing Web Services response structure, add the @legacy annotation on a category level. 
Use either Notepad or IntelliJ to edit the annotation. 

 * Web Services under a category with an @legacy annotation respond in the older structure. 

*  New Web Services under the same category align the Web Service response structure accordingly.
