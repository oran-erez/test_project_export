# Graphit Overview

Graphit is a Fabric utility which can be used to create dynamic CSV, XML and JSON documents and is very useful for generating Fabric [Web Services](/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/01_web_services_overview.md) responses. Graphit provides a very user-friendly interface and requires minimal coding while enabling powerful debugging capabilities. The content of a response is defined during its execution, either according to specific parameters relevant to the specific Web Service call, or by retrieving dynamic information from other databases or interfaces.

### Main Features
Using Graphit you can do the following:
- Create dynamic CSV, XML and JSON documents. 
- Accept external input as variables. 
- Use variables in queries.
- Execute queries on an LUDB, iterate over the results and use the returned values to create the response document.
- Execute queries on interfaces other than Fabric.
- Use prepared statements.
- Implement XML and JSON hierarchy, including queries in inner hierarchy levels. 
- Use outer level query results as arguments. 
- Recursively generate nested tags and structures.
- Customize the format of a value and define whether to generate a tag when the values are null or empty.
