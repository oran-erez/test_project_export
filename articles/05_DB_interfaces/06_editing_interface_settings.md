# Editing Interface Settings

Throughout a projectâ€™s lifecycle there are a number of reasons for modifying, disabling or deleting interface settings. For example, to update an IP address or the credentials of a DB you wish to access as a data source.

### How Do I Change an Interface's Connection Settings?

1.	Go to **Project Tree** > **Shared Objects** > **Interfaces** to open the **Interfaces list**. 
2.	Double click the **interface** to open it.
3.	Edit the [Connection Settings](/articles/05_DB_interfaces/03_DB_interfaces_overview.md#database-connection-settings).
4.	Click **Test Connection** to verify that the connection settings are correct:
       * If the connection is OK, the **Connection is OK notification** is displayed on the bottom of the window.
       * If the connection fails, a description of the problem is displayed on the bottom of the window.  
5.	**Save** the interface. 

Note that for the changes to become effective for the Fabric object (for example for Web Services or an LU), deploy each object to the server separately.
