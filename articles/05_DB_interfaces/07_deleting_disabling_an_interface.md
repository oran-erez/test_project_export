# Deleting / Disabling an Interface


## Deleting a Database Interface
A database interface can be deleted from Fabric when it becomes irrelevant.

### How Do I Delete an Interface?

1.	Go to **Project Tree** > **Shared Objects** > **Interfaces** to open the **Interfaces list**.
2.	Right click the **Interface** and click **Delete Selected Items**.

Note that for the changes to become effective for the Fabric object (for example for Web Services or an LU), deploy each object to the server separately.

## Disabling a Database Interface

A database interface can be disabled temporarily whereby it is ignored by Fabric. When needed, the interface can be enabled again. For example, when working in a test environment or when specific parts of a project are irrelevant or deprecated. 

### How Do I Disable an Interface?
1.	Go to **Project Tree** > **Shared Objects** > **Interfaces** to open the **Interfaces list**.
2.	Double click the **interface** and then change **Active** to **False**. An interface can be enabled or disabled when needed. 
3.	**Save** the interface.

Note that for the changes to become effective for the Fabric object (for example for Web Services or an LU), deploy each object to the server separately.
