# Edit Enrichment Order

## What Is an Enrichment Function?
An Enrichment function is a Java function without input/output parameters that is used to insert, update or delete an [LU table](/articles/06_LU_tables/01_LU_tables_overview.md).
* Enrichment functions are executed after the execution of all [population objects](/articles/07_table_population/01_table_population_overview.md) of  all LU tables. 
* One or several Enrichment functions can be attached to each LU table.

## What Is an Enrichment Order?
The execution order of all Enrichment functions is determined at the [LU schema](/articles/03_logical_units/03_LU_schema_window.md) level in the Enrichment Order tab. Only Enrichment functions that are directly related to specific tables are included in the display.

## How Can I Change the Enrichment Order? 
Use the **Up** and **Down** arrows in the **Enrichment Order** tab of the [**LU schema**](/articles/03_logical_units/03_LU_schema_window.md) to change the execution order of its Enrichment functions.
